There's only one
Trip you should take
It gets you there
Alters your state
I'm the only drug you need to take

High as a kite
King of the hill
I've got what you need
To give you a thrill
I'm the habit you don't need to break

Soon you'll need me
Constantly
Eyes that move you
Warms and soothes you

Soon I'll be there
I know you can't wait
To get what I've got
Surrender to fate
I'm the only drug you need to take

The more that you need
The more that you take
The sooner you'll want
The cure for your ache
I'm a bad habit you don't need to break

Soon you'll need me
Constantly
Eyes that move you
Warms and soothes you
This attention
Feels like heaven
Beats description

Like the best drug you could ever take
You'll get your fix when you look at my face
I'm a bad habit you don't want to break
